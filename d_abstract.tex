\section*{\centering{ABSTRACT}} 
The present work had for objective to analyze data, treat data, and try to predict the score of a movie based only on data gathered from other movies. The main goal of this work is that any person who has an interest in data mining can use the data results generated here to expand the conclusions made. It is based on the concepts of data warehouses, data mining, CRISP-DM, machine learning and using tools such as \pdi and WEKA, as well as the python programming language with the assistance of some libraries.
In this work, it was possible to conclude that predicting the score of a movie requires a lot of data analysis. Even so, it was possible to predict the score with a small margin of error.
